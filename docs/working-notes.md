# Working notes — collaboration style & project state

For the project owner (Eric) and any future Claude session. Technical rules live in
`CLAUDE.md`; this file carries the *conversational* context that doesn't fit there.
Last updated: 2026-07-02 (end of the fin-editor work, before heavy user testing).

## How Eric works / prefers to collaborate

- **Discuss before changing.** When Eric says he wants to talk something through,
  do NOT start implementing — analyze, present options with honest effort estimates,
  and wait for a decision. He asks sharp questions and decides quickly once informed.
- **Issue reporting is batched.** Eric tests thoroughly, then delivers one aggregated
  list. Exception: anything that *blocks further testing* is reported immediately and
  alone. Agreed report shape: what he did → what he expected → what happened
  (verbatim error text), a repro `.ork` where relevant, tagged blocking/annoying/cosmetic.
- **Sequential decisions.** He prefers finish-then-decide over speculative planning
  (e.g., "I'll decide about Phase 3 after testing"). Don't push him to pre-commit.
- **He is the visual QA.** Claude cannot see the rendered UI; Eric reloads
  http://localhost:4180 and reports. Never claim UI "works" — claim it builds, tests
  pass, and ask him to verify.
- **Real use case:** he designs almost exclusively with **freeform fins** and uses
  **rounded or airfoil (pointed) cross-sections — never square**. Anything degrading
  those paths hits his primary workflow. This is why cross-sections + freeform were
  pulled forward out of Phase 3.
- His preferred fin-design workflow: click points roughly in a visual editor, then
  refine exact values in a coordinate table. Both stay in sync (implemented).

## Decisions made (and why)

- **Engine strategy:** carve OpenRocket's real Java kernel, compile with TeaVM,
  differential-test JVM↔JS. Chosen over a TS rewrite after spikes proved bit-parity.
- **Fidelity discipline:** carved sources are never edited; changes go through
  `engine-java/patches/` + `LEDGER.md`. Desktop-compat is *proven* via the real
  OpenRocket loader (headless JAR harness in `engine-java/tools/GenerateOrk.java`),
  not assumed.
- **Repo moved out of Dropbox** (2026-07-02) to `G:\git\online_open_rocket` — Dropbox's
  driver corrupted git object writes. GitHub is the sync channel. Never move it back.
- **Deterministic simulations by choice:** wind turbulence is seeded (default 42), so
  identical inputs give identical results — intentionally different from desktop,
  which time-seeds.
- **Units at the boundary:** engine is pure SI/radians; UI speaks mm/°/g; converters
  live only at the edges (lesson from upstream bug #2475).

## Project state at sign-off

- **Done:** Phase 0 (spikes), Phase 1 (MVP: engine, API, UI, thrustcurve.org, .ork),
  Phase 2 (tree editor, 3D view, launch conditions, 12 plot series, full-tree .ork),
  plus fin cross-sections and freeform fins with the click/drag+table editor.
- **2026-07-03: first batch of Eric's test issues fixed** — see
  `docs/testing/issues-2026-07-03.md` and the item-by-item status in
  `docs/testing/response-2026-07-03.md`. Shipped: fin default position, clear-all,
  sliders everywhere, full design readouts (dry/loaded mass+CG, stability cal+%),
  nose shoulders + solid flag, surface finishes, mass/CG/Cd overrides, parachute
  deployment events. New engine bridge fields required a TeaVM rebuild
  (differential re-passed) and the .ork writer now has **CG parity** with the
  desktop loader too (found+fixed: hardcoded shapeparameter reshaped Haack noses
  on save — second instance of that war story, now regression-tested).
- **2026-07-03 (second pass): units/preferences shipped** at Eric's direction —
  desktop-mirrored unit groups (11 quantities, exact UnitGroup factors, metric/
  imperial default sets), radius-vs-diameter input preference (defaults to
  diameter), and light/dark/system theme, all in a persisted ⚙ Preferences
  dialog. Engine/.ork stay SI; conversions live in packages/app/src/prefs/.
- **Still open from the issue list (Eric-visible backlog):** component/material/
  parachute preset databases (browse/edit/CSV), snap-to-anchors +
  drag-in-preview, appearance colors, attribute audit vs desktop. Units polish
  candidates if Eric asks: fractional inches (in/64), in-place per-field unit
  click-through like the desktop, stability unit selection.
- **Pending decision (Eric's):** Phase 3 opens with either **deployment**
  (standalone hosting + WordPress embed — a founding goal) or **staging/clusters**
  (the flagship complex feature). Do not start either without his call.
- Verification state: all suites green (engine 8, app 11), differential 202 lines,
  desktop-loader mass+CG parity bit-exact.

## Notable technical war stories (details in docs/phase0-findings.md)

Worth remembering because they shape how we work:
- TeaVM 0.10 silently inverted NaN comparisons; 0.15 devirtualization/analysis
  needed `optimization = NONE` + `fastGlobalAnalysis = true`. **Never change those
  without a full differential pass.**
- Rollup tree-shook the entire engine out of a production bundle once (blank page)
  because TeaVM's UMD exports are dynamic — the artifact is now a native ES module.
- Hardcoded `shapeparameter` silently reshaped Haack noses (0.5 g phantom mass) —
  caught by the desktop-loader mass-parity check. That check is gold; keep using it.
- Square-vs-airfoil fin cross-section is a ~2× fin-drag difference — Eric's designs
  were significantly under-predicted before the fix.

## Practical bits

- Resume work: `cd G:\git\online_open_rocket` → `claude` (CLAUDE.md auto-loads).
- Run the app: `cd packages\app && npx vite preview --port 4180` (built dist), or
  `npm run dev` from the repo root for live-reload during development.
- Batch issue lists: markdown file preferred, e.g. `docs/testing/` + repro `.ork`
  files beside it (see below).
