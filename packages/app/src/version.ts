    items: [
      'NEW: ✂ DXF (CNC/laser, 1:1) — select a fin, centering ring, bulkhead, tube coupler or engine block and export its flat cut profile as AutoCAD R12 (AC1009) DXF in millimetres, the format LightBurn, Carbide Create, Easel, Fusion 360\'s sketch import and essentially every cutter\'s own software read. A fin comes out as ONE closed contour with the through-the-wall tab merged into it, so CAM offsets it correctly in a single pass; rings and bulkheads come out as true circles a machine can bore, with the centering ring taking its real bore from the motor-mount tube. Cut geometry is on the CUT layer alone — REFERENCE (root chord, centre marks) and TEXT (the label block) are guides, so switch them off before cutting.',
      'FIXED: elliptical fin sets exported the wrong outline. The 3D-printing STL (and any elliptical fin you had already exported) used a sine curve instead of a true ellipse, so the fin enclosed about 19% less area than the one the simulator flies and the one the 📐 SVG template prints. All three now use the kernel\'s own ellipse. Simulation results are unaffected — fin aerodynamics never read those points — but re-export any elliptical fin you cut or printed from an earlier build.',
      'The Mountain Man Rockets menu across the top is now LIVE: it reads the site\'s published menu on each load, so when the site adds or renames a page this tool follows on the next visit instead of waiting for an app release. The menu now matches the new site (Rocketry U, Tools & Techniques, Checklists & Info, Media…), gained a site search box, and picked up a small footer strip. It fails safe in every direction — offline, or if the site is unreachable, the menu that ships inside the app renders instantly, and nothing about the simulator depends on it.',

      'FIXED: the 2D and 3D views now draw the exact mathematical profile for every nose-cone and transition shape (ogive, conical, ellipsoid, parabolic, Haack, power — including the shape parameter). Before, the 2D view always drew a fixed ogive-ish nose and a straight-taper transition regardless of the selected shape, and the 3D transition was always a cone. The drawing math is a direct port of the kernel\'s own Transition.Shape equations, so what you see is what the physics flies.',

Blank = OpenRocket\'s default. It caps itself at each shape\'s legal maximum, and round-trips through .ork files as before.',

      'NEW: 2D drawing export with a data header — ⬇ SVG / ⬇ PNG buttons on the 2D view. The header carries the name, length/diameter/span, dry & launch mass, CG, CP, and stability margin (the numbers cert packets want). The SVG is sized in physical millimetres so it prints at true 100% scale; the PNG is 3840 px wide.',

      'Imports now DETECT hand-rolled camera shrouds (one-fin freeform sets named like "Camera Shroud") and offer one-click conversion to the native camera-shroud component — real frontal-area drag and as-built mass instead of a pretend fin. Dimensions carry over; mass uses your override or a density-based estimate.',
      'Tube-fin collision limits now hold with hand-typed values too: the outer-diameter field and slider cap at the touching radius for the current fin count, and the fin count caps at what physically fits the entered diameter. (Before, typing both values let the sliders push the tubes into each other.)',
      'A blank tube-fin outer diameter now shows the auto-computed touching diameter grayed in the field — the number you need to actually build the fins — and stays auto until you type over it.',
      'NEW: sub-minimum diameter rockets. On a body-tube motor mount, check "Sub-minimum: motor case is the airframe" — the motor browser then fits motors against the tube\'s OUTER diameter, so the case-diameter motor you\'re building around (fins bonded to the case, or propellant cast into the airframe) stays selectable. The aft view now draws the motor in body-tube mounts too. Flag round-trips through .ork.',
      'EX/research motors: import several .eng/.rse files at once, or point "📁 Import EX folder" at the folder where you keep them — every RASP/RockSim motor file inside joins your local library in one go (it persists in this browser; nothing is uploaded).

    items: [
      'NEW: every fin set (trapezoidal, elliptical, freeform, tube fins) has a Rotation field — turn the whole set about the body axis, so straight fins sit BETWEEN tube fins. It reaches the real physics (the kernel\'s base-rotation, an engine rebuild verified bit-identical at rotation 0), draws correctly in 3D and the aft view, and round-trips through .ork (the desktop\'s own tag) and RockSim (RadialAngle).',
      'RockSim imports auto-interleave colliding fin sets: RockSim renders tube fins + straight fins interleaved without storing an angle, so they arrived on top of each other — physically impossible. Overlapping same-angle sets now rotate by half the other set\'s pitch, with a note telling you what moved (the reported 4" Ultra Neon\'s tube fins come in at 30°). Adding a second fin set in the editor also defaults between the existing fins.',
      'NEW: 6-motor clusters batch as THREE opposite-tube pairs — the "mixed 4+2 / 2+2+2" checkbox flies every candidate combination across the three pairs, covering 4 of one + 2 of another AND three different motors in pairs (every pair is thrust-balanced, so all of it is symmetric — and much cheaper than buying 6 identical motors).

      'RockSim cluster reconstruction now tolerates RockSim\'s own rounding drift — real files write the same physical tube with slightly different diameters between copies (79.38 vs 79.375 mm in the reported 12" Darkstar), which silently broke the ring detection. Tubes now group within 1%, and that Darkstar\'s 6×75mm ring imports as one tagged 6-motor cluster around its central 98mm mount.',
      'The batch dialog gets a MOUNT picker: choose which motor mount the batch flies candidates in (the ring or the central mount, for example). Other mounts keep their currently loaded motors for every flight, so you can batch the ring while the central 98 carries its chosen motor. This is also why "mixed pairs (3+3)" seemed missing on 6-motor clusters — the option existed, but the batch was locked to the primary mount; pick the cluster mount and it appears.',

      'NEW: combination batching for 4- and 6-motor clusters. An opt-in "mixed pairs" checkbox in the batch dialog (off by default — the default batch still flies one motor type in every tube) also flies every PAIR of candidates split symmetrically across the cluster: 2+2 in opposite tubes on a 4-motor, 3+3 alternating on a 6-motor. The tube positions are exact — the cluster is split into two symmetric groups occupying the same holes. Larger clusters are deliberately out (no symmetric mixed arrangement worth flying), and the dialog shows the flight count before you commit — pairs grow fast.',
      'Combination results are grouped: a "Motor config" column (single / mixed 2+2) in every export, CSV sorted with single-motor rows first then the pairs, and the XLSX gets three tabs — All results, Single motor, Mixed pairs.',
      'Max motor length now lives ON the motor mount tube (Design tab), so it persists with the design — through sessions, .ork saves, everything. The Motors & Launch field became a per-stage OVERRIDE: it shows the design value as its placeholder, typing overrides it, clearing it falls back.

Length, width, height, three shapes (streamlined / half-round / box), as-built mass, color and finish. The physics: the side profile flies as a slender strake through the kernel\'s own low-aspect-ratio fin lift (the classic Jones model), drag uses Hoerner protuberance coefficients on the frontal area. Draws solid in 2D, 3D and the aft view; round-trips through .ork (desktop warns-and-skips); exports to RockSim as a mass object so CG survives.',
      'NEW: parachute spill holes — a spill hole ⌀ field on every parachute, flown as the standard effective-area reduction (RockSim\'s treatment). RockSim files with spill holes now import and export them instead of dropping them.',
      'The highlighted result tiles are now YOURS: a ⚙ button on the Results tab opens a picker with 14 metrics (recovery weight, thrust:weight, guide-departure velocity, drogue descent, pad weight, static margin, optimal delay and more).

Every preset that carries one (230 of 459, including all Fruity Chutes Iris Ultra at Cd 2.2) was silently simulated at the generic 0.8 — descent rates for those chutes were up to 1.66× too fast.
