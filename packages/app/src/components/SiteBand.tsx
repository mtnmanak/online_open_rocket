/**
 * The Mountain Man Rockets site band (spec §2, `docs/chrome-spec.md` in the
 * mountainmanrockets repo) — a slim strip above this app's own header carrying
 * the brand link, the site menu and a search affordance. It replaces the eight
 * hardcoded WordPress links this tool shipped through v0.043; the data now
 * comes from the published Nav Contract (see `services/useMmrNav.ts`).
 *
 * `target="_top"` on every link is load-bearing, not decoration: this app is
 * embeddable (vite `base: './'`), so a click has to navigate the WHOLE tab out
 * to the site rather than load mountainmanrockets.com inside a nested frame.
 *
 * The visual voice is deliberately the one the old `.site-nav` had — tracked
 * 11.5px caps on `--surface-2` with an orange hover — because that was tuned
 * to sit under this app's header without competing with it. Only the class
 * names changed, to the `.mmr-band-*` namespace the spec requires (MUST 5).

/**
 * MUST 1, "fail open": the calculator always outranks the chrome. Contract
 * data is remote and the band is the only thing rendering it, so a shape we
 * failed to anticipate must cost the user a menu — never the app. React
 * unmounts the whole tree on an uncaught render error, and this boundary is
 * what stops that tree from being the rocket designer.
 *
 * A boundary only catches errors thrown BELOW it, which is why every exported
 * component here is a two-line wrapper around a `*Body` that does the actual
 * reading of `nav`: put the `nav.nav.map` in the same component that renders
 * the boundary and the throw happens while building the boundary's own
 * element, one level too high to be caught.

 * keyboard handling, which is MUST 4 ("the tools own their keyboards"): Enter

 * input elements, so typing here cannot reach the undo stack.

 * open in a new tab — his words, "so the user is not completely taken away
 * from the site" — and every other GitHub affordance in this app honours it
 * (`App.tsx` uses `window.open(url, '_blank', 'noopener')`). The live
 * contract's `footer.links` contains "Bugs & requests" →
 * github.com/mtnmanak/mountainmanrockets-feedback/issues, so `_top` there
 * navigates the WHOLE tab off a half-finished rocket design.
 *
 * The local ruling wins, for github.com only. MUST 6's PURPOSE is escaping an
 * embedding frame, and `_blank` escapes one exactly as completely as `_top`
 * does — so the spec's intent is satisfied while its letter bends. Every
 * non-GitHub site link keeps `_top`, unchanged.
